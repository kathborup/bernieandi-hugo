Hello there marvellous reader! Thanks for joining me for my first ever post on my (fancy) new sewing blog!

Thought I'd start it off by writing a bit about why sewing plays such an importaint role in my life. Here are some positive qualities that sewing helps me cultivate:


Gratitude

When you visit a clothing store do you ever inspect the insides of a garment?  Have you ever geeked out over perfect piping or patch pockets?
If so you clearly appericiate good workmanship. 

In these modern times we have cleverly outsouced a lot of the less (immediatley) interesteting work to computers... its kind of surpising garments are still created using such traditional techniques. Sewing gives you that intimate understanding of clothing and the effort it takes to create it.


I definetley feel a lot of love for the items in my closet, handmade or otherwise! They reflect my personal style or provide a way to craft my identinty based on my current mood or mission.


Creativity

Whats better than having the freedom to makÃ© clothing you see in your head come to life? or modifying things so they are just right.

The planning stage is like the honeymoon phase of any project. You get inspired, you riff off different ideas and you get to entertain some of the endless possabilities.
I've been know to get lost looking through my fabric stash or my sewing patterns, Thinking about how I could hack this or how to best use that. It's something I just never ever get sick of!


Patience

![a picture of the skirt](/post/img/badzip.png)

Sewing can sometimes be a madening test of will. You make a perfect garment only to have the zipper break then you unpick holes in your fabric in an act of total frustration (zippers can sense fear). What about when the tensions off on your overlocker Or how about when youre on your 5th test garment but youre STILL not happy with the fit of that dress.

No judgements here if crazy swearing ensues.

Sewing WILL TEST YOU but you will also be rewarded for perseverence! No compliment or prize could be as uplifting as when you think of a better way to do something or you show that fabric whos boss.


Also sewing is a total antidote to the pace of modern life- This shit takes time!

The amount of time that goes into designing, fitting and making a garment would shock most of the non-seweing peeps! 
Have you ever had a non-sewer friend who just assumes you whip up a dress in an hour or 2?

I'm a speed sewer who avoids hand sewing and  I frequently sew multiple garments at once  BUT if you ask me how long it takes
to make a dress (from a woven fabric) it could be, depending on the style, over 5 hours from cutting out to the finished dress.


Mindfulness

![a picture of the skirt](/post/img/kathpressing.png)

I'm mesmerised when I see craftspeople working because I can relate to the flowstate that occurs. When youre sewing a pattern you love and you're going through the steps it can almost feel like a dance.

The surprising thing about sewing as a hobby is that it has the power to quieten down the mind and give you a sense of freedom from negative emotions.
Sure sewing can also cause anxiety (as learning any new skill can) but when the ritual of sewing becomes a part of your life it can be almost like meditation.
It's a beautful, tactile process of transformation.

I love designing and I'm often design graphics on my computer, but staring at a screen can't compare to the hum of the machine, the gentle of molding fabric with your iron or the crisp sound of sheers cutting through cloth. It's such a calming process


Generosity

My mum recently celebrated her 70th birthday. In many ways she is a woman I aspire to be like. Shes energetic and warm with boundless energy and enthusiasm. Sure can be intense and she can certainly talk your ear of at pretty much any hour of the day, but she has this beautiful compasionate heart that impacts almost everybody she comes into contact with. She also introduced me to sewing. No fabric was out of bounds in her sewing room just "as long as you cut from the side that had already been cut"

Mum and I still go fabric shopping together and though sewing can seem like quite a solitary hobby its also a wonderful way to connect with like minded people.
By sharing your creations online you come across a supportive comminity.

I love being inspired by what other people make just as much as I love sharing the things I create. It's better than any fashion magazine, because this is a beautiful diverse group of ladies and men who make things to suit THEM and theyre always happy to share ideas and offer advice.

I mostly make things for myself, so I still need to work on making more for others. Last year I taught 2 of my friends to sew and it was one of the most fun rewarding things I have ever done. 


Self acceptance

![a picture of the skirt](/post/img/tartanshift.png)

Sewing for yourself is more about personal style than about fashion. It has taught me about dressing my body and what does and doesn't work me!

I almost feel as though making your own clothing is a bit of a radical act. Youre not simply limited to whats availible or whats demed fashionable by magazines.

When I wear the clothing ive made I feel more confident! I'm celebrating my personality by wearing something tailor made for me.

Now when I try on RTW and the fit isant right it doesn't really mean that much. When you sew you learn about fit and tailoring clothing to your body, so the concept of a single size starts to sound silly. We are all so different and its time we start celebrating that!

I need clothing to fit in with my life and my sensabilities. I don't lead a glamorous life, but its MY life and I like it all the same!

What's better than having the freedom to make something you see in your head come to life as a three-dimensional object you can wear?! 

I love the planning stage! It's like the honeymoon phase of any project. 

You get inspired, you riff off different ideas and you get to entertain some of the endless possibilities. 

I've been know to get lost looking through my fabric stash or my sewing patterns, Thinking about how I could hack this or how to best use that. It&#146;s something I just never ever get sick of!

What about when the tension is off on your overlocker (at the worst possible time) or you're on your 5th test garment but you're still not happy with the fit of that dress.

I've had my share of throw-in-the-towel moments! If you've had these too I'm sure you can relate to the stress or the fits of crazy swearing.

I do graphic design work in my home and it requires sketching on paper, then working for many hours on my computer. But staring at a screen (for long periods of time) can't compare to the hum of the machine, the gentle of molding fabric with your iron or the crisp sound of sheers cutting through cloth. It's such a calming process!

Mum and I still go fabric shopping together! Though sewing can seem like quite a solitary hobby it's also a wonderful way to connect with like-minded creative people. By sharing your creations online you come across a fabulous, supportive community!

I almost feel as though making your own clothing is a bit of a radical act. You're not limited to what's available or what's deemed fashionable by magazines.

When I wear clothing that I've made I feel more confident! I'm celebrating my personality by wearing something tailor-made for me.

Now when I try on RTW clothing (in a shop) and the fit isan't right (on a garment in my size) it doesn't bother me, because when you're a sewist you know more about fit and the complexities of tailoring clothing to your body. The concept of a single one-size-fits starts to sound silly. We are all so different and it's time we start celebrating that!

I need clothing that fits me, my lifestyle and my sensibilities. I don't lead a glamorous life, but it's MY life and I love it!
